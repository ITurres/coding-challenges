# Tree Traversal

## Challenge

You will be given an array as input, which represents a Tree. Process the array into a Tree of Nodes, as shown above. Then go through the tree and print it in post-order.
Print each number space-separated.

### Example test case

```rb
tree = array_to_tree([10, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])

p post_order(tree)
# => 3 4 1 5 6 2 10
```
